This library is just wrapping https://github.com/edmund-wagner/junrar and sun's zip utilities.
It provides a more sane clojure interface for working with archives.

You can do fun stuff like:

(extract-files "https://github.com/bonega/pacl/zipball/master" "thesourceofthislib")

Just extracts all files from something that can be coerced into an inputstream

(with-open [a (open-archive "somefile.zip")]
           (compress (filter #(str-contains (:filename %) ".jpg") (:entries a)) "newarchive.zip" :method STORED)

Takes all .jpg entries in a zip and creates another archive with no compression

(compress-files ["data/"] "filename.zip")

compresses all files (or directories) to a new archive.

"open-archive" and "compress" tries to handle anything that quacks...
